# Key Terms

You’ll see these terms used often throughout our solution. Feel free to refer back to this table.

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **HABs (Harmful Algal Blooms)** | Rapid overgrowths of algae in seawater, often triggered by warm temperatures and nutrient pollution. They release toxins and organic gunk that clog and foul desalination systems. |
| **AOM (Algal Organic Matter)** | The mix of dissolved organic compounds released by algae—mainly proteins, polysaccharides, and acids. It causes “slimy” fouling in filters and RO membranes. |
| **TEP (Transparent Exopolymer Particles)** | Sticky, web-like organic particles secreted by algae during blooms. They act like biological glue, clogging UF (ultrafiltration) and RO (reverse osmosis) membranes and increasing the need for chemical cleaning. |
| **PAC (Powdered Activated Carbon)** | A fine, highly porous form of carbon added before filtration. It adsorbs (binds) organic compounds, toxins, and odors from the water, protecting downstream membranes. |
| **DAF (Dissolved Air Flotation)** | A pretreatment step that releases microbubbles into water to float and remove algae, PAC, and other suspended solids before filtration. |
| **UV254** | A sensor measurement of how much UV light at 254 nm is absorbed by organics in water, basically a real-time indicator of how “gunky” the water is. |
| **FDOM (Fluorescent Dissolved Organic Matter)** | Organic compounds that fluoresce under specific light; used as an optical proxy for algae-derived biopolymers like TEP. |
| **SDI (Silt Density Index)** | A measure of how quickly fine particles clog a filter. Lower SDI = cleaner feedwater = longer membrane life. |
| **RO (Reverse Osmosis)** | The main desalination step where high-pressure pumps push seawater through semipermeable membranes to remove salts and contaminants. |
| **UF (Ultrafiltration)** | A membrane filtration step before RO that removes fine particles and microorganisms but not dissolved organics like AOM/TEP. |
