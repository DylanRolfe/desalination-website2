# Impact

Across roughly **100-200 HAB-affected SWRO plants**, every improvement in uptime compounds into human, economic, and environmental gains at a global scale.

## Human Impact

Each day of HAB-related shutdown in a 1 000 mÂ³/day plant represents **1 000 mÂ³** of lost water. That is enough to supply **500 households** for a day in arid zones.

When scaled across 100-200 large coastal SWRO plants facing HAB risk, annual downtime adds up to **4 â€“ 15 days per facility**, translating to **600 000 â€“ 2 250 000 mÂ³** of lost water supply.

| Scenario | Plants Affected | Average Downtime (days) | Water Lost (mÂ³/year) | People Affected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Conservative | 100 | 4 | 400 000 | 200 000 |
| Typical | 150 | 10 | 1 500 000 | 750 000 |
| Severe | 200 | 15 | 3 000 000 | 1 500 000 |

Even one additional week of uptime could restore reliable water for hundreds of thousands of people annually.

## Economic Impact

Each HAB event forces 1. shutdowns, 2. chemical cleanings, and 3. membrane replacement. Cleaning alone costs **$500â€“5 000 per incident.** Energy losses also add up quickly.

For a 1 000 mÂ³/day plant:

- 10 days of downtime = **$15 000â€“30 000** in direct costs.
- Indirect losses (labour, energy, deferred output) add **another $5 000â€“10 000**.

| Scenario | Plants Affected | Cost per Plant ($/year) | Total Annual Cost ($) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Conservative | 100 | 4 000 | 400 000 000 |
| Typical | 150 | 4 000 â€“ 6 000 | 600 000 000 |
| Severe | 200 | 10 000 | 2 000 000 000 |

## Environmental Impact

Each cubic metre of desalinated water requires **3â€“5 kWh** of energy, depending on recovery rate and membrane efficiency. Every cubic metre of downtime avoided prevents 1. wasted pumping, 2. backwashing, and 3. chemical use.

- **Energy Savings Estimate:**
    - 1 000 mÂ³/day plant, 10 days avoided = **30 000â€“50 000 kWh saved**
    - Across 150 plants, **4.5â€“7.5 million kWh/year saved**
- **Carbon Conversion (assuming 0.4 kg COâ‚‚/kWh):**
    - **1.8â€“3.0 million kg COâ‚‚ avoided** annually (â‰ˆ **1 800â€“3 000 tonnes**)

| Metric | Unit | Typical 150-Plant Savings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Energy Saved | kWh/year | 4 500 000 â€“ 7 500 000 |
| COâ‚‚ Avoided | tonnes/year | 1 800 â€“ 3 000 |
| Chemical Use Reduced | % | 10 â€“ 25 % |
| Brine Discharge Reduced | mÂ³/year | 300 000 â€“ 500 000 |

## Leverage Multiplier

Increasing desalination reliability underpins other critical systems.

When water supply stabilizes, it prevents production barriers in **agriculture, manufacturing, food processing, and healthcare**, where desalinated water feeds boilers, cooling systems, process streams etc.

A 5â€“10 % increase in average plant uptime across HAB-affected facilities translates to **0.5â€“1.0 million mÂ³/year** of additional treated water.

That surplus water equates to:

- **$0.5 â€“ 1.0 billion USD** in recoverable infrastructure value, and
- Sustained operational security for thousands of coastal enterprises.

| System | Dependency | Uptime Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agriculture (Hydroponics, Cooling) | Desalinated feedwater | + 5â€“10 % irrigation stability |
| Manufacturing & Energy | Boiler/Cooling water | + 3â€“5 % throughput reliability |
| Healthcare & Tourism | Municipal supply | Fewer disruptions in critical services |

Water reliability is economic reliability. The uptime can compound across different systems.
