# Impact

This is a **$15.6M–81.3M/year** opportunity.

Losing 1,000–2,000 m³/year/plant means less drinking water for communities—like enough for 500–1,000 people yearly per plant (assuming 2 m³/person/year). Across 9–19 plants, that’s water for thousands of people, a huge XPRIZE impact. Underdosing makes plants shut down more, hurting water supply during blooms.

(underdosing calculations)

Algae blooms stop desalination plants, losing **400,000–1,500,000 m³/year** of water ($40M–150M, $400K–1.5M/shutdown per 1,000 m³/day plant). PAC in 10–20% of plants saves **800–4,500 m³/shutdown**, but manual dosing loses **5,000–80,000 m³/year** ($0.62M–10.1M). Not using PAC in 80–90% misses **32,000–405,000 m³/year** ($3.2M–40.5M). Total fixable: **37,000–485,000 m³/year** ($3.8M–50.6M).

Our solution can potentially save **37,000–485,000 m³/year** of usable water across the world.
