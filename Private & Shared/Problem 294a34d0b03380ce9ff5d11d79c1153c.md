## Key Terms (read this first)

You’ll see these terms used often throughout our solution. Feel free to refer back to this table.

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **HABs (Harmful Algal Blooms)** | Rapid overgrowths of algae in seawater, often triggered by warm temperatures and nutrient pollution. They release toxins and organic gunk that clog and foul desalination systems. |
| **AOM (Algal Organic Matter)** | The mix of dissolved organic compounds released by algae—mainly proteins, polysaccharides, and acids. It causes “slimy” fouling in filters and RO membranes. |
| **TEP (Transparent Exopolymer Particles)** | Sticky, web-like organic particles secreted by algae during blooms. They act like biological glue, clogging UF (ultrafiltration) and RO (reverse osmosis) membranes and increasing the need for chemical cleaning. |
| **PAC (Powdered Activated Carbon)** | A fine, highly porous form of carbon added before filtration. It adsorbs (binds) organic compounds, toxins, and odors from the water, protecting downstream membranes. |
| **DAF (Dissolved Air Flotation)** | A pretreatment step that releases microbubbles into water to float and remove algae, PAC, and other suspended solids before filtration. |
| **UV254** | A sensor measurement of how much UV light at 254 nm is absorbed by organics in water, basically a real-time indicator of how “gunky” the water is. |
| **FDOM (Fluorescent Dissolved Organic Matter)** | Organic compounds that fluoresce under specific light; used as an optical proxy for algae-derived biopolymers like TEP. |
| **SDI (Silt Density Index)** | A measure of how quickly fine particles clog a filter. Lower SDI = cleaner feedwater = longer membrane life. |
| **RO (Reverse Osmosis)** | The main desalination step where high-pressure pumps push seawater through semipermeable membranes to remove salts and contaminants. |
| **UF (Ultrafiltration)** | A membrane filtration step before RO that removes fine particles and microorganisms but not dissolved organics like AOM/TEP. |

## Where it all begins - Harmful Algae Blooms

### What are they?

Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are like giant clouds of tiny algae, called phytoplankton, that grow out of control in the ocean, turning water red, green, or brown. Some algae make toxins or sticky gunk (AOM or TEP) that cause trouble for water plants. In 2025, HABs have intensified due to warmer oceans, pollution, and climate change, hitting coastal areas where desalination plants clean seawater for drinking. 

### How they cause trouble:

Globally, an estimated **16,000–23,000 desalination plants** operate today, with roughly **1,000–2,000 classified as large-scale SWRO facilities** capable of treating more than 100,000 m³/day.

During major HAB events, **organic loading** in feedwater can spike from baseline levels (< 10 mg/L) to **50–150 mg/L**, rapidly fouling RO membranes. Around **10 %** of large SWRO plants (roughly **150 facilities worldwide)** are likely affected each year by HAB-related shutdowns or performance declines.

A typical bloom lasts **five to ten weeks**, while individual plants may experience **4–15 days of downtime** per event for membrane cleaning and recovery. Cleaning cycles cost anywhere from **$500–$5,000** per incident depending on plant scale and chemical use.

### The Big Impact

For a 1,000 m³/day plant, one HAB event loses 4,000–15,000 m³. Across 100–200 plants, that’s **400,000–3,000,000 m³/year**. At $1–2/m³, it costs **$400,000–6,000,000/year**. That’s water for 200,000–1,500,000 people (2 m³/person/year).

HABs reduces available water, especially in dry areas relying on desalination (66% of capacity is SWRO). Fixing HABs can unlock millions of cubic meters of water and help thousands.

| Problem | Plants Affected | Water Lost (m³/year) | Cost ($/year) | People Affected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HABs | 100-200 | 400,000–3,000,000m³ | $400K–6M | 200,000–1,500,000 |

    💡
    
    There are 16000-23000 SWRO plants in the world. We filter large plants because only large SWRO plants use PAC and DAF, and HABs only hit coastal/large SWRO plants. So to get the right number of HAB-affected plants that could use PAC, we:
    
    1. Start with ~1,000–2,000 large SWRO plants (the only ones with DAF/PAC systems).
    2. Then take 10% of those = 100–200 HAB-affected plants.

## Plants use PAC to combat HABS, but not enough.

### What is PAC?

Powdered activated carbon (PAC) is like a super sponge made from tiny grains of carbon that soak up the sticky gunk (AOM/TEP, 50–150 mg/L)^1^ ^6^ ^7^ and toxins (e.g., domoic acid, >10 µg/L)^7^ from HABs in seawater. When added to water before it hits desalination filters, PAC grabs 50–70% of the gunk and 80–95% of toxins, keeping reverse osmosis (RO) membranes (0.1–0.4 µm pores) clean and running smoothly.^18^ 

<aside>
💡

For a 1,000 m³/day plant hit by a HAB (4–15 days downtime), PAC cuts downtime by 20–30%. That saves 800–4,500 m³ of clean water per algal bloom.^19^ It’s a game-changer for keeping water flowing.

</aside>

- Is PAC a smart choice?
    
    <aside>
    💡
    
    1. PAC is super cheap. It costs just $0.01–0.02/m³ to treat water, compared to Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF, $0.02–0.05/m³) or Ultrafiltration (UF, $0.05–0.15/m³).^20^ DAF uses bubbles to float gunk away but needs big tanks and energy (1–2 kWh/m³ vs. PAC’s 0.1–0.2 kWh/m³), while UF’s tight filters (0.01–0.1 µm) are great but pricey to install and maintain ($10,000–50,000/year for a 1,000 m³/day plant).^21^ 
    2. PAC is simple: mix it into the water, let it soak up the bad stuff, and filter it out before RO. It works in any plant, even older ones built before 2010 (70–80% of large SWRO plants).^22^
    </aside>
    

### The Problem: Not Enough Plants use PAC.

Despite PAC’s benefits, only 10–40% of the 100–200 HAB-affected large SWRO plants (10–40 plants) use it.^23^ That means 90–160 plants miss out on saving 800–4,500 m³ per bloom, or 48,000**–720,000 m³/year** across 90–160 plants with one HAB event/year ($48,000–1,620,000 at $1–2/m³).^24^ Dosing PAC is tricky. It is like guessing the right amount of sugar for a giant cake, too much or too little messes things up because they rely on manual dosing.^25^ This pushes plants to stick with DAF or UF, even though they’re costlier.

## Plants are limited to manual-dosing, and it is bad.

PAC dosing automation sounds like the dream, but plants are limited to manual-dosing because of **4 big challenges**.

- Current Automations are unaffordable
    
    Current automated dosing systems cost $20K–50K per plant, too expensive for most (web:7). Smaller plants (1,000 m³/day) can’t justify the cost, and even larger ones hesitate due to high upfront investment.
    
- Complex Water Testing
    
    Checking algae gunk (AOM/TEP, >15 mg/L) and toxins (>10 µg/L) requires lab tests or expensive sensors ($10K–20K), which take hours and aren’t real-time (web:22). Workers use slow methods like jar tests to guess PAC doses.
    
- Lack of Expertise
    
    Many plants lack staff trained in automated systems, so they stick to manual dosing despite its flaws (web:27).
    
- Retrofit Challenges
    
    Older plants (70–80% of large SWRO, built pre-2010) weren’t designed for automation, making upgrades costly and complex (web:8, web:36).
    

<aside>
💡

Unable to transition to automated systems, manual dosing leads to mistakes and extra work. Of the 10–40 PAC-using plants, 90–95% (9–38 plants) rely on manual dosing. It causes errors (5–10% overdosing/underdosing, web:22) and wastes time (1–3 hours/day, web:27). This makes PAC seem unreliable, so most plants avoid it, missing out on saving 64,000–810,000 m³/year ($64K–1.62M at $1–2/m³) if half (40–90) adopted it (web:5, web:7).

## But how bad is manual-dosing?

We broke down the water and cost wasted due to each causes. We also quantified the missed opportunity, showing that manual dosing is an urgent issue.

Manual dosing in 9–38 plants (90–95% of 10–40 PAC-using plants) causes:

- Overdosing: Wastes $9–292/plant/year ($81–11,096 across 9–38) (web:23).
- Underdosing: Loses 9,000–76,000 m³/year ($9K–7.2M) due to 5–10% errors compounding's and leading to membrane clogging (web:22, web:10, web:11).
- Worker Hassle: Costs $720–4,380/plant/year for 36–219 hours on daily dosing adjustments and $6,480–166,440/year for 9-38plants.
- Sludge: Costs $216–876/plant/year ($1,944–33,288) (web:28).
- Inconsistent Results: Loses 4,500–38,000 m³/year ($4.5K–76K) (web:7, web:10).
- Equipment Wear: Adds $900–19,000/year (web:28).

**Total: Wastes 13,500–114,000 m³/year ($13.5K–228K) and $9,405–229,824/year across 9–38 plants.**

<aside>
💡

 Manual dosing wastes up to 114,000 m³/year. That is enough for 57,000 people yearly.

## The Gold Mine Opportunity.

Manual dosing is bad, but the bigger issue is 90–160 plants (80–90%) that avoid using PAC because it’s hard (web:15, web:30, web:31). If half (40–90) used PAC with an easier way (ie. Automated Dosing), they’d save 64,000–810,000 m³/year ($64K–1.62M) (web:4, web:7, web:5). Fixing manual dosing in 9–38 plants saves 13,500–114,000 m³/year ($13.5K–228K) and $9,405–229,824/year (web:7, web:22, web:23, web:27, web:28). 

**Total: 77,500–924,000 m³/year ($77.5K–1.848M)**, helping 38,750–462,000 people.

💡

An easier way saves water for up to 462,000 people!
